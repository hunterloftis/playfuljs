In this article, we&#39;ll compose a first-person exploration from scratch,
quickly and without difficult math, using a technique called raycasting.
You may have seen it before in games like Daggerfall and Duke Nukem 3D,
or more recently in Notch Persson&#39;s ludum dare entries.
If it&#39;s good enough for Notch, it&#39;s good enough for me!

<p>Raycasting feels like cheating, and as a lazy programmer, I love it.
You get the immersion of a 3D environment without many of the
complexities of &quot;real 3D&quot; to slow you down.
For example, raycasts run in constant time,
so you can load up a massive world and it will <em>just work</em>, without optimization,
as quickly as a tiny world.
Levels are defined as simple grids rather than as trees of polygon meshes,
so you can dive right in without a 3D modeling background or mathematics PhD.</p>
<p>It&#39;s one of those techniques that blows you away with simplicity.
In fifteen minutes you&#39;ll be taking photos of your office walls and
checking your HR documents for rules against &quot;building workplace gunfight simulations.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="the-player">The Player</h3>
<p>Where are we casting rays from? That&#39;s what the player is all about.
We need just three properties: x, y, and direction.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">function Player(x, y, direction) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
  this.direction = direction;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-map">The Map</h3>
<p>We&#39;ll store our map as a simple two-dimensional array.
In this array, 0 represents <em>no wall</em> and 1 represents <em>wall</em>.
You can get a lot more complex than this... for example,
you could render walls of arbitrary heights, or you could
pack several &#39;stories&#39; of wall data into the array,
but for our first attempt 0-vs-1 works great.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">function Map(size) {
  this.size = size;
  this.wallGrid = new Uint8Array(size * size);
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="casting-a-ray">Casting a ray</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s the trick: a raycasting engine <em>doesn&#39;t draw the whole scene at once.</em>
Instead, it divides the scene into independent columns and renders them one-by-one.
Each column represents a single ray cast out from the player at a particular angle.
If the ray hits a wall, it measures the distance to that wall and draws a rectangle in its column.
The height of the rectangle is determined by the distance the ray traveled -
more distant walls are drawn shorter.</p>
<p><img src="../images/raycaster-idea.png" alt="Raycasting basic idea"></p>
<p>The more rays you draw, the smoother the result.</p>
<h4 id="1-find-each-ray-s-angle">1. Find each ray&#39;s angle</h4>
<p>First, we find the angle at which to cast each ray.
The angle depends on three things: the direction the player is facing,
the focal length of the camera, and which column we&#39;re currently drawing.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var x = column / this.resolution - 0.5;
var angle = Math.atan2(x, this.focalLength);
var ray = map.cast(player, player.direction + angle, this.range);
</code></pre>
<h4 id="2-follow-each-ray-through-the-grid">2. Follow each ray through the grid</h4>
<p>Next, we need to check for walls in each ray&#39;s path.
Our goal is to end up with an array that lists each wall the ray
passes through as it moves away from the player.</p>
<p><img src="../images/raycaster-grid.png" alt="Raycaster grid"></p>
<p>Starting from the player, we find the nearest horizontal (<em>stepX</em>) and
vertical (<em>stepY</em>) gridlines.
We move to whichever is closer and check for a wall (<em>inspect</em>).
Then we repeat until we&#39;ve traced the entire length of each ray.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">function ray(origin) {
  var stepX = step(sin, cos, origin.x, origin.y);
  var stepY = step(cos, sin, origin.y, origin.x, true);
  var nextStep = stepX.length2 &lt; stepY.length2
    ? inspect(stepX, 1, 0, origin.distance, stepX.y)
    : inspect(stepY, 0, 1, origin.distance, stepY.x);

  if (nextStep.distance &gt; range) return [origin];
  return [origin].concat(ray(nextStep));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finding grid intersections is straightforward: just look for whole numbers of <em>x</em> (1, 2, 3, etc).
Then, find a matching y by multiplying by the line&#39;s slope (rise / run).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var dx = run &gt; 0 ? Math.floor(x + 1) - x : Math.ceil(x - 1) - x;
var dy = dx * (rise / run);
</code></pre>
<p>Did you notice what&#39;s awesome about this part of the algorithm?
We don&#39;t care how big the map is!
We&#39;re only looking at specific points on the grid - approximately the same number of points each frame.
Our example map is 32 x 32, but a map that&#39;s 32,000 x 32,000 would run just as quickly!</p>
<h4 id="3-draw-a-column">3. Draw a column</h4>
<p>Once we&#39;ve traced a ray, we need to draw any walls that it found in its path.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">  var z = distance * Math.cos(angle);
  var wallHeight = this.height * height / z;
</code></pre>
<p>We determine the height of each wall by dividing its maximum height by <em>z</em>.
The further away a wall is, the shorter we draw it.</p>
<p>Oh damn, where did this <em>cosine</em> come in?
If we just use the raw distance from the player, we&#39;ll end up with a fisheye effect.
Why? Imagine that you&#39;re facing a wall. The edges of the wall to your left and right
are further away from you than the center of the wall.
But you don&#39;t want straight walls to buldge out in the middle!
To render flat walls as we really see them, we build a triangle out of each ray
and find the perpendicular distance to the wall with cosine. Like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/raycaster-distance.png" alt="Raycaster distance"></p>
<p>And I promise, that&#39;s the hardest math in this whole thing.</p>
<h3 id="render-the-damn-thing-">Render the damn thing!</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s use a Camera object to draw the map each frame from the player&#39;s perspective.
It will be responsible for rendering each strip as we sweep from the
left to the right of the screen.</p>
<p>Before it draws the walls, we&#39;ll render a skybox -
just a big picture in the background with stars and a horizon.
After the walls are done we&#39;ll drop a weapon into the foreground.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">Camera.prototype.render = function(player, map) {
  this.drawSky(player.direction, map.skybox, map.light);
  this.drawColumns(player, map);
  this.drawWeapon(player.weapon, player.paces);
};
</code></pre>
<p>The camera&#39;s most important properties are resolution, focal length, and range.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Resolution</em> determines how many strips we draw each frame: how many rays we cast.</li>
<li><em>Focal length</em> determines how wide of a lens we&#39;re looking through: the angles of the rays.</li>
<li><em>Range</em> determines how far away we can see: the maximum length of each ray.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>
<p>We&#39;ll use a Controls object to listen for arrow keys (and touch events)
and a GameLoop object to call requestAnimationFrame.
Our simple gameloop is just three lines:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">loop.start(function frame(seconds) {
  map.update(seconds);
  player.update(controls.states, map, seconds);
  camera.render(player, map);
});
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-details">The details</h3>
<h4 id="rain">Rain</h4>
<p>Rain is simulated with a bunch of very short walls in random places.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var rainDrops = Math.pow(Math.random(), 3) * s;
var rain = (rainDrops &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; this.project(0.1, angle, step.distance);

ctx.fillStyle = &#39;#ffffff&#39;;
ctx.globalAlpha = 0.15;
while (--rainDrops &gt; 0) ctx.fillRect(left, Math.random() * rain.top, 1, rain.height);
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of drawing the walls at their full width, we draw them one pixel wide.</p>
<h4 id="lighting-and-lightning">Lighting and lightning</h4>
<p>The lighting is actually shading.
All walls are drawn at full brightness, and then covered with a black rectangle of some opacity.
The opacity is determined by distance as well as by the wall&#39;s orientation (N/S/E/W).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">ctx.fillStyle = &#39;#000000&#39;;
ctx.globalAlpha = Math.max((step.distance + step.shading) / this.lightRange - map.light, 0);
ctx.fillRect(left, wall.top, width, wall.height);
</code></pre>
<p>To simulate lightning, <em>map.light</em> randomly spikes to 2 and then quickly fades down again.</p>
<h4 id="collision-detection">Collision detection</h4>
<p>To prevent the player from walking through walls,
we just check his future position against our map.
We check x and y independently so the player can slide along a wall:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">Player.prototype.walk = function(distance, map) {
  var dx = Math.cos(this.direction) * distance;
  var dy = Math.sin(this.direction) * distance;
  if (map.get(this.x + dx, this.y) &lt;= 0) this.x += dx;
  if (map.get(this.x, this.y + dy) &lt;= 0) this.y += dy;
};
</code></pre>
<h4 id="wall-textures">Wall textures</h4>
<p>The walls would be pretty boring without a texture.
How do we know which part of the wall texture to apply to a particular column?
It&#39;s actually pretty simple: we take the remainder of our intersection point.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">step.offset = offset - Math.floor(offset);
var textureX = Math.floor(texture.width * step.offset);
</code></pre>
<p>For example, an intersection with a wall at (10, 8.2) has a remainder of 0.2.
That means that it&#39;s 20% from the left edge of the wall (8) and 80% from the right edge (9).
So we multiply 0.2 * texture.width to find the x-coordinate for the texture image.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s next?</h3>
<p>Because raycasters are so fast and simple, you can try lots of ideas quickly.
You could make a dungeon crawler, first-person shooter, or a grand-theft-auto style sandbox.
Hell, the constant-time makes me want to build an oldschool MMORPG with a massive,
procedurally generated world.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hunterloftis/playfuljs-demos">Fork the code</a>!</p>
<p>Here are a few challenges to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immersion. This example is begging for full-screen mouse-lock with a rainy background
and thunderclaps synchronized to the lightning.</li>
<li>Optimization. Lots of speedups possible here, starting with caching the identical
<em>Math.atan2</em> and <em>Math.cos</em> calls we make hundreds of times each frame.</li>
<li>An indoors level. Replace the skybox with a symmetric gradient or, if you&#39;re feeling
plucky, try rendering floor and ceiling tiles (think of it this way: they&#39;re just
the spaces between the walls you&#39;re already drawing!)</li>
<li>Lighting objects. We already have a fairly robust lighting model.
Why not place lights in the world and compute wall lighting based on them?
Lights are 80% of atmosphere.</li>
<li>Good touch events. I&#39;ve hacked in a couple of basic touch controls
so folks on phones and tablets can try out the demo, but there&#39;s huge room for improvement.</li>
<li>Camera effects. For example, zooming, blurring, drunk mode, etc.
With a raycaster this are surprisingly simple. Start by modifying camera.fov in the console.</li>
</ul>
